## Include A Section That Tells Developers How To Install The App

To enjoy the experience of unpredictable meals, simply download the APK file to your phone, install and run it. Its that simple! :smile:    

For developer who wants to refine/extend the App, please download the whole folder and manage/ edit it in your preferable IDE. Please also install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and an IDE such as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install).

This App uses 2 google maps APIs: geocode and nearby search. In addition, it uses 2 services from Firebase: Authentication and Firestore Database. Please note the API keys in the folder will be depreciated in months. Please kindly replace with you own API key for geocode and nearby search function. For Firebase application, please create a firebase project. Register you App on Firebase by providing your own ```applicationID``` in ```android>app>build.grade``` (for Android App) and download and (re)place the json config file in the Android app module root directory.   

For getting a key for google maps APIs, please refer to [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Maps%20Platform%20%3E%20Credentials%20page.&text=On%20the%20Credentials%20page%2C%20click,Click%20Close.).  
To set up Firebase in your Flutter App, please refer to [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=android).
